<h1>Lakshya Priyadarshi</h1>

<p>I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu">Computer Science</a> department of <a href="http://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a>, advised by <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~rfonseca/">Rodrigo Fonseca</a>. I'm broadly interested in operating systems and computer networks, which has led to my current focus on distributed systems, such as the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> implementation of MapReduce, and the Internet. My research is currently exploring new designs for collaboratively sharing network resources, network filesystem issues in Hadoop, and the use of ISP backbone networks.</p>

<p>From 2011-2014, I will be supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship (<a href="http://ndseg.asee.org">NDSEG</a>).</p>

<p>I spent the summer of 2013 at <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> (Mountain View) in the Platforms Networking Group. After graduation, I will be joining Google (Sydney), and continuing to develop software-defined networks.</p>

<p>I spent the summer of 2012 at <a href="http://www.cloudera.com">Cloudera</a> (San Francisco) working to improve resource management across the Hadoop ecosystem.</p>

<p>I spent the summer of 2011 at <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Research</a> (Redmond) working with <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/peterb/">Peter Bodik</a> and <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/UM/people/srikanth/">Srikanth Kandula</a> on resource allocation in Cosmos/Dryad on <a href="http://www.bing.com">Bing</a>'s clusters.

<p>In June 2008, I graduated from <a href="http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a>. My interest in probability and statistics led me to major in <a href="http://www.orfe.princeton.edu">Operations Research and Financial Engineering</a>, with a healthy serving of <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu">Computer Science</a> courses on the side.</p>

<p>You may also be interested in my <b><a href="docs/CV.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a></b>, or the list of <a href="courses.html">courses I have taken</a>. As a curious computer scientist, I occasionally <a href="http://twitter.com/adferguson">use twitter.</a></p>

<h3>Current Research</h3>

<p><a href="http://pane.cs.brown.edu" class="title">Participatory Networking</a><br />
I am developing a new platform for managing network resources by allowing end-users and their applications to safely, securely, and collaboratively manage such resources for themselves. This platform, which we term &ldquo;Participatory Networking,&rdquo; forms the next layer in Software-Defined Networks by providing &ldquo;system calls&rdquo; for non-administrative users. This project is developed jointly with Brown's <a href="http://brownplt.github.com/">programming languages</a> group.
</p>

<p><span class="title">Analysis of ISP Networks</span><br />
By combining passive network measurements with a detailed analysis of publicly available data, I am seeking to give researchers and smaller ISPs greater visibility into the construction and utilization of Tier 1 ISP backbones. This is joint work with my advisor, Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~rfonseca/">Rodrigo Fonseca</a>. We have explored the use of the IP Timestamp option to probe router and link properties, and are currently measuring the rate of structural change in a large ISP's network.
</p>

<p><span class="title">Task Scheduling and Block Placement in Hadoop</span><br />
I am working with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~rfonseca/">Rodrigo Fonseca</a> and Brown's <a href="http://database.cs.brown.edu">database group</a> to understand cluster workload characteristics and improve task scheduling in the Hadoop platform for MapReduce. I have worked to optimize data layout in the Hadoop distributed filesystem, and am currently engaged in a project to build a <a href="http://database.cs.brown.edu/projects/las-vegas/">new filesystem for Hadoop</a> integrating recent advances in database research.</p>

<h3>Past Research Projects</h3>

<p><span class="title">Utility-based Cluster Scheduling</span><br />
Working with colleagues at Microsoft Research, I designed scheduling mechanisms for MapReduce-style clusters which maximize global utility of compute jobs, and are capable of meeting service-level agreements (SLAs) with high probability.</p>

<p><a href="http://election.princeton.edu" class="title">Princeton Election Consortium</a><br />
I assisted Prof. <a href="http://synapse.princeton.edu">Samuel S.-H. Wang</a> with creating and refining statistical models for the most accurate meta-analysis prediction of the 2008 election, and among the most accurate for 2012. I also developed the automated website infrastructure and prepared visualizations. Our work has been featured in many venues including <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>NPR</em>, <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>, and <em>The Atlantic</em>, among other publications.
</p>

<p>
<a href="docs/FergusonIW.pdf" class="title">Exploring the Yeast Genome with Generalized Singular Value Decomposition</a><br />
For my senior independent work, I applied a technique from matrix analysis to compare data previously clustered using hierarchical methods, yielding a substantial processing speed-up while reproducing and extending previous results.

Since 2009, I have served as an elected representative to the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/cis/about/itab.php">Information Technology Advisory Board</a>, a committee charged with studying the use of technology on campus and advising the university leadership on technology decisions. With the growth of out-sourced cloud-computing options, I think it is an important time for students of distributed systems to be involved in the IT-investment conversation. Since 2012, I have served as an elected representative to the <a href="http://www.brown.edu/Administration/Provost/committees/urc/">University Resources Committee</a>, which makes University-wide financial decisions on topics such as salaries, tuition, financial aid, and budget requests.
</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Brown Computer Science</span><br />
I am a co-organizer of <a href="http://rest.cs.brown.edu">Research Exchange Seminars with Tea (REST)</a>, a weekly talk series by computer science graduate students designed to foster collaboration and disseminate new techniques across subfields. Since Fall 2012, I have also been the coordinator of the <a href="http://systems.cs.brown.edu/sysread/">Systems Lunch / Reading Group</a>.</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Conference Reports for  <a href="http://www.usenix.org/">USENIX</a> <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/"><i>;login:</i></a></span><br />
I wrote <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/reports.html">summary reports</a> of talks given at <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/inmwren10/">INM/WREN 2010</a>, <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi10/">NSDI 2010</a>, <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/nsdi11/">NSDI 2011</a>, and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi12/">NSDI 2012</a> for the USENIX <i>;login:</i> magazine.
</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Open Source Contributions</span><br />
I previously maintained <a href="http://www.rdiff-backup.org">Rdiff-Backup</a>, a Python-based cross-platform backup solution using the rsync algorithm in use worldwide. I helped prepare the Windows port and improved file extended attribute handling on Mac OS X. I'm a former developer for the <a href="http://www.afterstep.org/">AfterStep</a> Window Manager, where I focused on the configuration GUI and parsing the options files. My patches have been included in <a href="http://floodlight.openflowhub.org">Floodlight</a>, <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>, <a href="http://zookeeper.apache.org">ZooKeeper</a>, <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>, <a href="http://www.samba.org">Samba</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/SWIMProjectUCB/SWIM">SWIM Benchmark for Hadoop</a>.
</p>

<h3>Just For Fun</h3>

<p>
<a href="cerf/index.html" class="title">Vint Cerf wants YOU to use IPv6</a><br />
I think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf">Vint Cerf</a> makes a great Uncle Sam, so I created this propaganda to help raise awareness of the transition to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a>.
</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Office Toys</span><br />
To honor the memory of my now-graduated office mate, <a href="http://home.ku.edu.tr/~akupcu/">Alp K&uuml;p&ccedil;&uuml;</a>, I assembled the 6' tall "<a href="photos/knex_tower.jpg">K'nex HyperSpace Training Tower</a>" where he used to sit. I made a stop-motion video of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jouui2Pi9JI">the assembly process</a>, and a short video showing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckot2gKGkPY">the tower in action</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="chazelle/The_Chazelle_Show.mp4" class="title">The Chazelle Show</a><br />
As an undergraduate, I compiled the best clips of <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/">Bernard Chazelle</a> lecturing in the <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/integratedscience/">Integrated Science</a> course during the Fall of 2004. You've never seen the inverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function">Ackerman function</a> explained quite like this before...
</p>

<p>
<a href="programming_languages.html" class="title">A (Narrow) History of Programming Languages</a><br />
In 2000, when I was in <a href="http://www.prs.k12.nj.us/">eighth grade</a> I wrote a report about the history of programming languages. For several years after I wrote it, the text was available online and it became a reference for other articles, Wikipedia entries, and even college courses. I have placed the report here for posterity and amusement (<em>how could I have possibly left out Python??</em>).
</p>

<p>
<span class="title">Other Interests</span><br />
I developed a love for power tools during my years at Princeton, during which I spent all of my spare time involved with <a href="http://www.theatreintime.org">Theatre Intime</a>, the campus' only student-run theater. I'm happy to say that I successfully hooked my sister on its productions before extricating myself. :-)
